# 🛒 Walmart Clone – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Welcome to my mini project – a simple **Walmart Clone** built using only **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**. This project focuses on replicating some core shopping features like product listing and cart functionality.

## ✅ What’s Inside

- **Home Page**  
  A basic landing page styled to look like the Walmart homepage with a link to view all products.

- **All Products Page**  
  Displays a list of products with:
  - Image
  - Title
  - Price
  - Star rating
  - "Add +" button

- **Cart Functionality**
  - As you add items, the total price updates instantly.
  - No page reload needed – handled with simple JS DOM manipulation.

> ⚠️ This is a frontend-only demo. No frameworks or databases are used.
